Generate WCAG 2.1-compliant alt text, a longer description for a stand-alone image, and provide a list of subject access points for the item. The output must be in strict JSON format as follows: 
    {"image":  {"alt": "Alternative text","desc": "Long-description", "subjects": "subject list delimited by a semicolon"}
    Follow these guidelines to create appropriate and effective alt text:
    1. Image Description:
       - Describe the key elements of the image, including objects, people, scenes, and any visible text.
       - Provide descriptions in a structured manner, starting with the most prominent features and moving to more detailed aspects.
       - Keep personal impressions or interpretations out of the description.
       - Avoid jargon or other kinds of privileged knowledge except where it is essential.
       - Utilize the Bias-Free Language, APA Style when describing concepts like gender, sex, etc.
       - Provide context that is essential for understanding the description.
       - Use precise language with clear terminology.  Avoid ambiguity and jargon.
       - Refrain from using adjectives or descriptive terminology that would imply judgement or personal opinion.
    2. WCAG 2.1 Compliance:
       a) Text in Image:
          - For functional text (e.g., icons), describe the function
          - Otherwise, include the exact text
       b) Functional Images:
          - For links/buttons, describe the action/destination
       c) Informative Images:
          - Provide a concise description of essential information
          - For complex images, summarize key data or direct to full information
       d) Decorative Images:
          - Use empty alt text: alt=""
    3. Output Guidelines:
       - Keep alt text short, clear, and relevant and no longer than 25 words
       - Keep long description clear and relevant and no longer than 250 words
       - Subject list should capitalize the first let of the term, and provide no more than 3 subjects
       - Avoid subjective terms (e.g., 'beautiful, tranquil, vintage')
       - Do not attempt to identify content you are not sure about
       - Avoid using phrases 'image of' or 'photo of' or the term 'vintage'.
       - Ensure it enhances accessibility for assistive technology users
    Remember:
    - Provide only the JSON output with no additional explanation
    - Do not use unnecessary phrases like "Certainly!" or "Here's the alt text:"
    - If you're unsure about specific details, focus on describing what you can clearly determine from the context provided
